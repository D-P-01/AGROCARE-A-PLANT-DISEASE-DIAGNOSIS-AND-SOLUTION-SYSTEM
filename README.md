In India, agriculture contributes over 17% of the nation's GDP and employs almost half of the workforce, making it a vital sector. It is significant for the economy of India.  Nevertheless, every year pest and disease outbreaks destroy crops valued at over 50,000 crores. Early plant disease diagnosis is crucial to putting an end to this. Furthermore, the conventional approach of disease identification, which involves manual examination by experts or farmers, is quite expensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, they are unachievable for millions of small and medium-sized farmers worldwide.Seeing or understanding this problems we decided to work on this project.

Project summary:
• Developed an application predicting over 30+ crops diseases and offering solutions for this plant diseases.
• Employed a design thinking approach to create an intuitive solution. This involved creating a user-friendly interface for farmers to easily upload images of affected crops and receive accurate disease predictions and used 60000+ images for training this model.
• Utilized CNN, Numpy, Pandas, Reznet34 model and transfer learning, achieving an accuracy of 92%.
